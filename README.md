Bike image generator (deep learning)


We have tried to compare the creative image generator of the following scientific article: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06242

Modern machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, are transforming many disciplines ranging from image recognition to language understanding, discovering patterns in big data and making accurate predictions. They also showed promising results for the synthesis of new designs, which is crucial for creating products and enabling innovation. Generative models, including GANs, have proven effective for design synthesis with applications ranging from product design to metamaterial design. These automated computer design methods can support human designers, who typically create designs through a time-consuming process of iterative exploration of ideas using experience and heuristics. However, there are still challenges to automatically synthesize "creative" designs. GAN models, however, are not capable of generating unique designs, a key to innovation and a major gap in AI-based design automation applications.

The article we looked at offers an automated method, called CreativeGAN, for generating new designs. It does this by identifying components that produce a unique design and modifying a GAN model so that it becomes more likely to generate designs with identified unique components. The method combines novelty detection, segmentation, novelty localization, rewriting, and state-of-the-art generative models for creative design synthesis. Using a dataset of bicycle designs, the authors demonstrate that the method can create new bicycle designs with unique frames and grips, and generalize rare novelties to a wide range of designs. The automated method requires no human intervention and demonstrates a way to rethink the synthesis and exploration of creative design.

We sought to compare the method of these authors with the original GAN method, in order to verify that the designs generated by the CreativGAN algorithm are indeed original.


Here is the result we got after 100 epochs :
